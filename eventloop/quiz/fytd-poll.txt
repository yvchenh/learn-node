- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
1.someAsyncOperation() is initiated but completion will depend on the asynchronous I/O operation.
2."foo" is logged to the console from the foo() function.
3."done" is logged to the console immediately after foo() completes.
4.After the above synchronous code has executed and the file read operation has completed, the callback passed to fs.readFile in someAsyncOperation() is executed, logging either "Read Error" or "Data: " + data.
