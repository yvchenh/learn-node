- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

The fs.readFile callback begins execution once the file read operation is complete.
The blocking operation occurs, lasting for about 10 milliseconds.
Error checking and data logging happen immediately after the blocking operation.
The setImmediate callback is likely to execute next, logging that it was scheduled to run immediately.
Finally, the setTimeout callback executes, logging the delay since it was scheduled, which should be slightly more than 5 milliseconds due to the timing of its scheduling and the event loop's operation.
