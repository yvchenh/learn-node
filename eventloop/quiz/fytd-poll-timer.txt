- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

A setTimeout callback is scheduled to execute after 100 milliseconds. 
The function someAsyncOperation is called, which begins an asynchronous file read operation.
Node.js's event loop handles different types of tasks in specific phases. 
The setTimeout callback is set to execute after 100ms. However, its execution can only occur after the event loop reaches the timers phase and the timer has completed its countdown.
